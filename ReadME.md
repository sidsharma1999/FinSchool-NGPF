In my work as a data analyst, I was required to analyze and collect information surrounding the state of financial literacy in the United States. This was a 4 month project where I managed a team of 3 other employees to collect this data. The data was analyzed using Python and I was the sole contributor to the code base.

Course Compare - Grouping all courses by school, analyzing their descriptions and criteria, then spitting out a grade either "Gold", "Silver", or "Bronze" Standard. 
Full List - combining all state level and national datasets to create a full list of each school and their various stats (reduced/free lunch, income of surrounding area, etc.)

Other code portions aren't shared publically because they are sensitive to the company. Thank you!
